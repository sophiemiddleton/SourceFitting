# SourceFitting

## Running the fits:

* FitMacro.C - this calls RooFit and fits a combined fit to the data for each crystal

To run this code: root .L FitMacro.C

This will provide a .root file with the total width, peak and errors from all 674 fits

* analysis.py

This is a basic script which will show distribtions and correlations in fit parameters and chi-squared
